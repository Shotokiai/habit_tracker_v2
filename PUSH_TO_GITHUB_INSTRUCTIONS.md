# 🚀 Push Your Code to GitHub - Next Steps

## ✅ Done So Far
- Git initialized ✓
- All files staged ✓
- Initial commit created ✓

## 📍 What's Next

You need to push this to your GitHub repository. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository
3. Name it: `habit-tracker-v2` (or your preferred name)
4. **Do NOT initialize with README** (we already have commits)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Add Remote and Push

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in PowerShell:

```powershell
cd "c:\Files\acer\Personal Projects\habit_tracker_app\code (1)"

# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/habit-tracker-v2.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/habit-tracker-v2
2. You should see all your files and commit history ✓

### Step 4: Connect to Vercel

Once code is on GitHub:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click "Import Project"
3. Select your GitHub repo
4. Click "Deploy"
5. Your app will be live in 2-3 minutes!

## 📋 What Will Be Pushed

Your repository will include:

✅ 3 new React components (OnboardingScreen, HabitCategoryScreen, CustomHabitScreen)
✅ Updated App.tsx with complete state management
✅ 10 comprehensive testing guides
✅ 3 automation scripts
✅ All configuration files

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Replace YOUR_USERNAME** with your actual GitHub username
2. **GitHub will ask for authentication** - Use your GitHub token or credentials
3. **First push might take a minute** - Large file size
4. **Vercel will auto-deploy** after you connect the repo
